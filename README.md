## About ShowGitFlux

ShowGitFlux is a web-app that i'm actually building from scratch for,
First, improve some skills, and review old basics,
Secondly, i've been looking around to find someone that let me fetch my git activity from different instance, private and public. ( Gitlab & Github basically ).
